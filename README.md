### python script for modeling NOCT emissions

emissions are dispersed on a per-block basis to loan owners  
the amount rationed to an address is a function of the following variables:  
- a loan's maximum accrued interest amount
- the sum of all active loan's maximum accrued interest amount
- total NOCT distributed per block, as defined by the DAO

if you decide to run the script, be aware that it is RAM intensive  
reducing the loanCount value with reduce RAM requirement significantly
